prayag is called the king of pilgrimages

in the puranas the story regarding prayag being called the pilgrim king is also found

there is a story among all the gems that came out during the samudra manthan elixir also came out to achieve which the gods and the demons began to compete

the drops of elixir fell on the earth at four places

first in prayag then nasik ujjain and in haridwar

since then till today kumbh and ardhkumbh fairs are organised at all these four places at times

according to a story brahma and rishis questioned sheshnag regarding prayag being the king among pilgrimages

on being told by sheshnag brahma put all the pilgrimages and saptpuris on one side of libra and only prayag on the other but the scale shifted towards prayag and then prayag status as the king of pilgrimages was established

it is said that the moment a person enters the border of this area then at every step he gets the result equivalent to one ashwamedha yajna

all the pilgrimages of the world has come out of prayag prayag has not come out of other pilgrimages that is why prayag is called the king of pilgrimages

according to the padmapuran the way the world is created out of the universe universe does not arise out of the world in the same way the other pilgrimages have arisen out of prayag

in the prayag district capital of maharshi yayati pratisthapur and the ashram of the guru of lord shri krishna and sudama sandipani are situated

lord buddha had given the sermons of buddhism for several years in this very city and emperor ashok had erected one of his pillars in the king of pilgrimages prayag itself which is present even today

aadiguru shankaracharya had also visited here and his meeting with kumaril bhatta ready for self immolation in the woodfire also occurred here

it is believed that aadi shankaracharya had given the magh fair of prayag the form of a national festival

on the day of new moon of magh sun and moon remains in the capricorn at the same degree of the earth

that is why in order to get salvation it is important to take bath and perform yagna in the month of magh especially on the day of new moon

magh fair is held in prayag every year

every sixth year ardhkumbh and every twelfth year kumbh is held

the kumbh fair in prayag is held three years after the haridwar kumbh fair and there is a three year difference between the kumbh fairs of prayag and nasik but the kumbh of nasik and ujjain are celebrated in the same year

sometimes the kumbha of nasik takes place before ujjain

kumbha festival cycle is as follows

the kumbh festivals of all the four places have been related with the astrological calculation and the main dates of bathing

there have been different opinions of various scholars regarding the kumbh cycle

some scholars fix kumbh festival in the twelfth year itself

according to the second opinion the auspicious time of kumbh does not occur until the astrological conjunction does not form

if the equation of the other planets do not agree then the kumbh festival can take place in the eleventh and the thirteenth year also

this kind of situation arises because of the western effect of jupiter and the time of its revolution around the sun

jupiter plays an important role in deciding some festivals

from the point of view of the division of time from among nakshatras and sun signs and planets the th sun sign is the aquarious

aquarius is an aquatic sun sign

saturn is the boss

saturn is the air element

water and air this is the environment

sun earth fire elements obviously have importance

the kumbh of haridwar is symbolic of this very sun sign

one day of gods is equivalent to the one year of the humans

this is the reason why according to the serial order of the position of the planets kumbh festival is celebrated at four places in the twelfth year

this festival itself is the synonym of the fair

it becomes clear from the study of the puranas that the kumbha festival and the ganges have a special relationship

ganga is obviously there in prayag

the godavari of nasik is also a confluence

it is known by the name of gautami

shipra becomes eastward from the place where it was once hugged by ganga

a linga named gangeshwar there is worshipped by ganga

during low tide sea creatures can be seen in pirotan islands

located at a distance of kilometres from the jamnagar of gujarat there is a group of such islands which are shelter of different types birds of national and foreign origin

rich with mangrove the pirotan island is ideal not only for these birds but are source of several types of sea creatures as well

watching the sea creatures in their natural habitat in pirotan island is a unique experience

to conserve these very different colors of life in water the government of india declared these islands conserved area in

after two years these islands got the pride of becoming first national marine park of the country

there is an abundance of mangroves on the marshy surface of the pirotan islands

the roots of mangrove are situated at some height from the surface so that they can receive the necessary amount of oxygen from air

several small aquatic creatures are generated in the roots of the mangroves

the leaves of mangroves are the food of several small creatures living in water

even birds flying in the heights of sky depend on these very mangroves for their food

this is the reason that these grasslands situated in the sea are called the source of life also

to be the view of this extraordinary world of the sea life one has to get the permission from the office of national marine park located in jamnagar then starts a journey which reveals several mysteries of sea life

just as we reached the bedi port our sights fell on a big group of birds and dolphins hopping on the surface of water also was seen

we started our travel from the bedi port

just as we reached the port our eyes fell on a large group of birds which became invisible from eyes touching the shore in seconds

we had not yet covered even a few minutes of our journey as luck gave us company and we saw dolphins hopping on the surface of water

seeing these dolphins playing in water it was appearing as if they were welcoming our arrival to this island

as we were reaching near the island mangrove forest and bevy of different kinds of birds sitting on its branches were getting clearer to our eyes

preying birds like hover and marsh herrier were flying at some height above the level of water with their focussed eyes and sharp claws

as soon as it saw a prey it pounced with the electrical agility on them and got hold of them in its sharp claws

here we also got to see a bevy of rare birds like pallas fish also

from far off the light house of pirotan island was visible to us

in about two hours we covered this journey filled with adventure

wearing a cover of the golden sand on the shores of this island innummerable crabs crawling on the ground will come to your sight

to see and undersatand the natural diversity of pirotan island it is imperative to have a guide

the nearest airport of pirotan island is at a distance of seven kilometers in jamnagar

the nearest railway station of pirotan island is jamnagar and rajkot at a distance of kms

the best time for going to pirotan is between october to april

as if a standstill came in the surface of the sea that is the situation of low tide was created

with the guide of the forest department sheelu bhai we went out to see the unique scene of life in water

here in the clean water we got to see so many ranges of rocks of coral

seeing these rocks it was appearing as if it was a treasure of preciuos stones

in reality these dazziling ranges of rocks play the role of security shield to micro organism with the decreasing level of water and the effect of light this range turn more beautiful and colorful

the first sea creature on which our sights fell was octopus

perhaps it had got a feeling of the fact that we had seen it and like a lizard it adapted itself in the color of the stone

for the first time we were seeing any sea creature so closely

on the surface of its body there were several small pores

through which it tightens its prey strongly in its hold

the speciality of this illusory creature is that it can adapt itself into different color according to the environment

as soon as sheelu bhai freed it it emitted liquid substance of black color into water and disappeared like smoke

there are many such creatures in the sea that use their unique abilities either to hunt or to protect themselves from getting hunted

star fish can separate its arms from its body as soon as it comes in the clutches of the hunter

fish named puffer can even enlagre its body three times bigger that its real size

seeing it any one can get hallucinated that it is a powerful big fish

it was a thrilling view to see different races of crabs present here

apart from blue neptune red coral the upper part of the body of some was covered with thorny hair which sheelu bhai gave the name of wolf crab

just in a while our meeting with star fish and puffer fish also occurred

as soon as sheelu bhai picked up the puffer fish in his hands it bloated like a balloon

it is really a workable mechanism for protection

one more interesting fact about this fish is that puffer is one among those fish which can blink its eyelids

a different type of octopus jelly fish red coral which looks very attractive

with the kingfisher many alluring and unique birds are visible in the port which keep the environment resonant

to see these creatures living in the water you may have to get down two to three feet into water

therefore tourists should keep special care for this fact that they wear such shoes which can keep them protected from the poisonous creatures living in water

in the clean water of the sea groups of colorful sea lily and sea pen enchanted us

looking like a garden in reality this beautiful view is not of any flora but of group of sea creatures

which while attracting fish and other small creatures towards themselves make them their prey

as the day started to pass by we came back to the island

far from the life of town filled with hubbub and hurly burly there is also a shrine where local people came sometimes and performed namaz

there is neither proper arrangement for food nor for drinking water on this island therefore before coming here tourists should make proper arrangements for drinking water and food

generally all the tourists return back by the evening but we decided to spend the night here and we got permission too

when the redness of the setting sun behind the horizon fall on this island then its natural beauty gets enhances four folds

in the darkness of the night in this peaceful island only squeals of the waves are heard

while returning from the island we saw kingfisher on the mangrove

looking at a large group of sea crows it was appearing as if they were following us

when we got up due to chirping of birds then the scene here was really spellbinding

seeing the birds flying in the sky it was appearing as if they were drawing different shapes

if you were lucky you would see a mammal creature looking like a seal named dugong which is on the last brink of extinction today

as there started a stir in the sea water we understood that the level of water is rising

the phenomenon of the rise of sea water is called high tide

in high tide the level of water comes to such a height that the boat can float easily

now we decided to bid adieu to this island

the sea has god knows how many mysteries wrapped in its lap to become face to face with which pirotan island is appropriate

located at a distance of kilometres from bedi port pirotan island is famous for sea creatures along with its unique natural beauty

height of feet from sea level whistling winds shiver giving cold only snow in four directions lake frozen with ice human skulls and remains scattered everywhere on ice

this sight of the mysterious rupkundh lake can run a shiver through the bodyin excessive heat also in bitter cold you can imagine yourself

this view is of the mysterious rupkund lake

to see the mysterious rupkhund lake is a dream of every trekker and the journey of this will give a challenge to his courage

a group of some experienced and brave trekkers got together and took the decision to make this difficult journey from this very road

the journey for mysterious rupkhand lake begins from lohagunj to reach till where are two roads one via rishikesh kandprayag tharali debal and the other via kathgodam gwaldam tharali

along with preparations for trekking we also took part in the aarti on triveni bank of mother ganga and prayed for the welfare and success of our journey

during the journey from kandprayag to debal pindar river was with us after that via mundauli we reached lohaganj lrb lrb meters by evening

from lohagunj the huge peak of trishul lrb lrb meters can be clearly seen

our goal was at the feet of rupkund and homkund

after bowing head to mahadev and nanda devi ji we began our journey

near the vaan lrb lrb meters forest rest house in the park we fixed our tent

by three a light drizzle began and we were forced to go inside the tents

at dawn we went in an ancient temple nearby

our difficult journey was to begin from today in the right aspect

first the climb was light after that a levelled field came

here in one direction various kinds of flowers were scattered and some local people instructed us to go ahead fast

our goal of today bedni bugyal is right now very far

now there was approximately a descent of two kilometers after that crossing a mountainous river via a bridge we entered dense jungles

now there was continuous ascent our breath would shorten on walking some distance only

taking deep breaths making our breath regular we were going forward

the climb and the jungle both were just not coming to an end

slowly the jungle ended and we were in a bugyal lrb lrb an open field of grass

bedani region had already started but our camp was in bedani basin lrb lrb meter which was still one and a half kilometers away

all around fog had descended

walking slowly we reached bedani kund and set our tents in the field near to it

on the clearing of the evening weather we obtained the rare sight of peaks like trishul nandaghunti chaukhamba

one had to just see to believe the shadow of trishul in bedani hollow

with the intention of getting ourselves accustomed for the upcoming journey instead of going in the direction of rupkund the next day we made the program of going to the nearby aali bugyal

the beauty of aali bugyal was worth seeing carpet of green grass spread far on that scattered yellow flowers and sheep goats and horses roaming free

our evening was spent in the camp of bedani hollow

early morning the minute it was seven we started our journey

trees had left our company since long now only a few plants could be seen on the grass

on route we could see three potholes our guide told that the name of this place is pathar nachodi

it is said that three apsarahs had been sent to break the ascetic practice of some hermit

on the ascetic practice being broken the hermit overpowered by anger turned the fairies to stone

but in the stone form also the dance of those fairies continued so the hermit buried them in the potholes

the opinion of local people was this but the opinion of some people is this that these potholes might have been produced due to the falling of lightening

now there was the challenging sharp climb we were at a height of more than feet each step was becoming heavy

approximately after walking three kilometers it started snowing carefully stepping on the snow all reached rupkhand by half past seven

ice was frozen on the lake and a little away from there we also found human remains

everyone eyes were moist success was not felt yet

gradually everyone began to believe that ultimately we have reached rupkhund

then what the skies revererated with victory cries of shiva ji and nanda devi

ahead there was a small temple of nanda devi ji everyone bowed heads respectfully and distributed offerings of rasagullas

everyone was eager to capture this unique scene in their cameras

they were reminded that the journey has not yet ended instead scaling more height now had to reach shila samudra via jorawar lane

ahead there was only snow but everyone courage was high

the guide and his comapnions started making a path by cutting ice with an ice axe

crossing the feet height now we were at the edge of joravar lane

the weather was clear ahead were the skyscraping peaks of mrigthuni trishul and nandaghunti

after watching these rare sights from this height of feet for sometime we started descending the other side with the help of a rope

after crossing the snow only stones could be seen this was shilasamudra

on one side of us was mrigathuni the other side was trishul and on the third side nandaghunti peaks and we had just come from the fourth rupkhand

shilasamudra is a bottomless sea of stones

on the road from shilasamudra to homkund there are only stones

there was a need for great caution on the road from shilasamudra to homkund

each footstep had to be kept fixedly from some distance we found nandakini river coming from nandaghunti glacier

we were advancing forward finding a path among stones with care in the direction of the left bank of nandakini

evening four o clock we reached near two large rocks it is called dodang this only was our night camp

our goal was yet two kilometers away from homkund

dodang place was in the asolute middle of nandaghunti and trishul peaks and where the two peaks meet that is called ronti central

there was a severe winter in dodang by six o clock the waters of the close flowing sarita froze

just then we got sight of a rare animal bharal because of the false knowledge of there not being any danger from us these mountain goats looking like deer with their families began playing near us

tsomoriri lake t piece of the blue sky on the ground

at a distance of kilometer from leh included in the protected area situated in the midst of extensive mountain ranges and the roost of diversified birds at one end of the world the beauty of tsomoriri lake is unique

i am talking of the tsomoriri lake which is probably situated at one end of the world

the calm deep blue color of the water of tsomoriri lake makes this appear as if a piece of blue sky has come falling on the earth

situated at a height of approximately feet from the earth the tsomoriri lake is kilometer long and from eight to ten kilometer wide

the mountains on four sides of tsomoriri lake are always covered with snow

situated in the rupshu valley of ladakh the extremely beautiful tsomoriri lake is the breeding place for many kinds of birds

from june till september months specific kinds of swans high crested birds and brahmani ducks can be seen swimming in large numbers

the sweet water of tsomoriri lake is an invaluable gift of many migratory birds

after crossing a distance of kilometers from leh we had reached tsomoriri in the month of september

in ladakhi language the meaning of tso is lake

for coming till tsomoriri lake we had to cross leh upsi chumathang mahe and piga

in the middle falls nam sangla valley whose height is approximztely feet

approximately kilometers ahead from here is a small canal on crossing the bridge constructed on which moriri lake begins

outside strong freezing winds are blowing

it is not possible to stand till much time in the strong freezing winds and be able to take the pleasure of the beauty of the lake

according to dorjee lrb lrb driver we were going to karzok the village at the border

for going to karzok the road runs along the edge of the lake

after going five kilometers ahead from the road at the edge of the lake karzok village comes

karzok village is the permanent residence place of an aborigines changpa

sustaining the bad weather of karzok the changpa people do farming of barley here

it is believed that farming of barley in the highest area of the world is done in karzok

changpa rear yak sheep and goat and live all year in tents made of the black colored fur of the yak

pashmina goats are valuable assets of the changpa people

in days of winter thick hair grows on pashmina goats

in days of summer the changpa people make an accumulation of the hair shed by the pashmina goats

the hair shed by the pashmina goats is called pashm

the famous pashmina shawls of kasmir are made from pashm only

we had become tired by continuously doing mountain trekking for six hours

we were also feeling very hungry

on reaching karzok having eaten hot khichdi at a small restaurant made in a parachute tent the hunger subsided

when we stretched our arms and legs sometime in the warmth of the bed laid in the tent then we felt alive and the desire to do something awakened

we went to see the only gompa lrb lrb budhha temple of the village situated in the vicinity

the entrance door of the main temple of the gompa lrb lrb budhha temple is very colorful and pictorial

having climbed the roof of the inclusion room of the gompa saw tsomoriri ourselves

the heart lifted up on having seen a fascinating flock of birds of tsomoriri with binoculars

from the roof of the gompa tried to see the tents of the changpa aborigines but could not see

maybe on going more ahead from here viewing would have happened

the map of karzok is changing with the new buildings constructed of concrete according to the usage of the cities

its obvious that in this way there can be infiltration unknowingly in the natural beauty and tradition of the village

seeing this from the roof of gompa wished that if there remained fixed a traditional culture here instead of modern culture then such a unique view would have been seen

tsomoriri situated in rupshu valley is a cultural area

therefore for entering in tsomoriri travellers require a permission letter

on requesting this permission letter can be obtained free from the deputy collector office situated near of the polo ground of leh

the permission letter is obained for minimum four persons and maximum for one week

travellers are given advice that make many photo copies of the permission letter because this is asked at many check posts

consume adequate water during journey

the way of water consumption compensates less oxygen in the environment

here at a barrier of the forest department the checking of our permit was done and the fixed tax for tourists and car was recovered from us and our entry was made in a register

the path from here to binsar was very narrow and we were having to drive the car with great care

on route we could also see famous ancient temples

the road otherwise was of kilometers only but due to the road being narrow to reach binsar it had taken us approximately three quarter of an hour

here our meeting happened with a young man named pradeep who was going to take us to the highest place in binsar zero point in the morning

the next morning it was very cold

we were walking fast for zero point because we wanted to see the sight of the first rays of the sun falling on the frozen white peaks of the himalayas

one advantage of coming here in the month of november was this that the sky was absolutely clear

ahead the peaks of the himalayas were touching the sky with pride

there are many estuaries made with the streams of rivers in karnataka

among these are walls growing from the western ghats

from these many touch the arabian sea

inside the sea two small islands also appear to welcome the guests with open arms

there are religious tales of all islands of karnataka including these islands

between lal and karbar there are more than eight such beaches which are away from inhabitation

in these the nature of most is spotless even now

if we leave om beach someshwar lrb lrb ulal surkthakal malpe marwanthe someshwar lrb lrb bayandur murudeshwar gokarn and karwar beaches then most beaches are far away from commercialisation even today

one can go on these shores

national highway will make you roam all the shores of karnataka

here doing a long drive is an experience of freshness of its own

there is also religious significance of someshwar beach near of ullal

here near the mouth of the sea is the temple of someshwar

southern kannada is situated quite close to the summer sand beach resort temple

for setting camp this place is the best and economical too

surkthakkal is situated in the north of mangalore city

the shore here is the best place for an agreeable evening

six kilometres west from udupi malpe is the best gem of this range

especially the journey from malpe to saint mary island is quite thrilling for sightseers

in marvanthe the national highway runs just near to the sea shore

near the highway kollur river can also be seen

seeing the sea on one side of the highway and on the other the river is charming in itself

near to baindur someshwar is an untouched beach

here the baindur river mingles in the arabian sea

there is a temple on the edge of someshwar beach only

here from the peak of a mountain the charming view of the sunset happening in the sea can be seen

on this mountain only the forest department has made a resort

as if this place lies separate from the whole world

the sea shore of the northern edge district is also very beautiful

murdeshwar situated here is a good religious place

kilometres away from here netrani island group can also be visited

for this a boat journey of approximately one hour has to be done

if the shores here are the crown then the kohinoor of this crown is karbar shore

nobel prize winner poet rabindranath tagore has himself called this shore the most beautiful shore of the world

sitting on a heap of sand on karbar shore what a feeling does the experience of watching the setting sun descend into the womb of the sea gives this can only be felt on coming here

in pachmadi nature is seen with complete arts

the journey till pachmadi may have been very tiring but after reaching there whatever i saw that was enough to astonish

till where the sight used to go only greenery could be seen

it felt such that after wandering in a dark tunnel someone has come in the midst of blinding light

a place so cheap that any student can get enjoyment here with only one month worth of pocket money

meaning come here open your luggage and get involved in search

after strolling for some hours in the midst of waterfalls of fresh water and green lush jungles you will realize that every inch of pachmadi is screaming and saying search

pachmadi situated on the mountains of satapuda range in madhya pradesh if you want to go by plane then have to get off at bhopal airport

from bhopal airport pachmadi is kilometres away

for reaching pachmadi by rail route have to go to pipriya

from pipriya pachmadi is only at a distance of kilometres

for staying in pachmadi here apart from hotels in cheap prices lodge cottage bungalows and hut are available easily

after coming to pachmadi do not simply lose yourself in only natural beauty

do not forget to see the cave of the pandavas in pachmadi this is that place where the pandavas had stayed during the banishment

for animals birds lovers satapuda national park is a very beneficial place

those who enjoy thrills can go to churagarh temple situated on high mountains

the tour of the dark jatashankar caves is also not any less thrilling

while going to dhupgarh deep valleys and the crescendo of birds on the mountains feels very charming

after the fatigue of the whole day bathing in the waterfall of fresh water or difficulty filled trekking or after roaming in greenery behind the mountains of satapuda watching the sun set is a rare experience

after coming here the search of your peace can be definitely fulfilled

pathiramnal is an island of salt lake

the lake blue and spread over a large area beneath the canopy of the blue sky amazing natural beauty if you go to this place then you can not remain without being enchanted

pathiramnal is surrounded by a large area of backwater of the name vembanattu kayal of square kilometres

this is the largest lake in the lakes of kerala

pathiramnal is a natural lake

people from all parts of the world come here for seeing the beauty lake water and migratory birds

a large tourism and resort operator like the oberoi group has been proven unsuccessful in getting this in spite of having bid for this beautiful island

for this environmentalists should be given thanks who opposed this

beautiful pathiramnal is convenient in equal form for both the poor and the rich

although the lake is salty but this is a surprising fact that there is sweet water in the island

travellers of various states can utilise five star facilities and roam on the large lake sitting on motorboat speed boat or house boat

near pathiramnal there are many tourist spots and historic places

famous nehru trophy snake boat race had also happened near this island

prosperous people go abroad spending money to take pleasure of artificial islands

but pathiramnal is for those people who can not bear expenditures of lakhs but want to take pleasure

yes surrounded by water from four sides in the own country of god this is heaven on earth

you can reach pathiramanal by air route from any place of the world

you will disembark very close of this island

the nearest at kilometres is cochin international airport

pathiramanal is also linked by rail route

the names of the nearest railway stations are alapuzha and kottayam

both these stations are at a distance of kilometres

after disembarking in zurich i walked towards beautiful and cosmopolitan city geneva

this on common basis gives birth to the confusion of switzerland being the capital but is not

maybe the reason of this is that the whole world like the headquarters of united nations the world health organization red cross and international labor organization etc is there

all these especially the united nations are places worth visiting

the best thing is this that you can roam most places walking and the rest one or two places by bus

then it was said that i should definitely see an important archaeological place cathedral saint pierre

if these type of things do not attract you much then you can also leave it

but if you like places like these then you can spend your some time there

later went to red cross and red crescent museum

here the human atrocities happening in the recent history has been documented in the form of films statues and sound tracks

but the thing about geneva i liked the most and is also maybe the favorite of the tourists

that is walking along geneva lake and admiring jet d eau

one such a big fountain lrb lrb and the largest in europe also which throws water down from metres high in the air

the favorite work of the tourists is to keep standing there so some drops of water spread by gusts of wind touch their face with love

for this place you will not need any directions because this is seen from anywhere in the whole city

from my experience i can say this that less expensive hotels are in reality not less expensive

the best alternative is youth hostel where the expenditure of one night comes near of dollars

after deciding the place of staying roaming is most expensive

the better alternative is this that take travel pass

in switzerland there are many types of passes available which are the best for you choose that

now also this is right that take rail pass journey of bus and boat remain included in this

the price of a pass of one day is dollars

this is not some bad alternative because after this you can also undertake a journey anywhere in switzerland

although geneva is not a cheap place but nothing is cheap in switzerland

despite this spent only dollars everyday

on reaching there once you will feel that the most expenditure in switzerland happens on journey and food not necessarily in this order

even then reduction can be done in large measures in these

because the true beauty of switzerland is not in miracles made by humans rather in the raw colors of nature

london sitting on the piers of thames take unlimited enjoyment

paris the french kiss

to tell the truth the real pleasure of roaming in paris can be taken on foot

after coming out from the lobby of the hotel will walk only a little distance that metro station will come into view

from here you can go to any corner of paris

the place which me and my friends decided to see first that is regarded as the most beautiful street in the world

we are talking of champs xc x lys xc xa es lrb lrb although the french call it by the name of shonzalize

here are the most expensive houses and shops of europe

but do not hope for bargains

on both sides of paris from luxury stores to expensive cafes and restaurants

roaming comfortably we reached arc de triomphe

anyway for taking a view of the street it is necessary to give some rest to the legs

after eating drinking in mc donald there we also did photography for long

every corner of the store remains filled with the best things

in the shops outside of lafayette we also did a little shopping

stuff there was not very expensive

then the convoy of us friends reached one such place which you can call a small india

most people coming to paris like to see the eiffel tower first

this was not our first stage but then not the last as well

in the dark night sitting on a bench we kept admiring the eiffel tower for some time

our some friends went on the eiffel tower also taking tickets of twelve euros

it was not that there was less money with us and for that reason we did not go up

we had got to know that a sight like that from eiffel tower can be also be had free

so like the local people of paris we thought it better to climb the tour de montparnasse

paris was looking so beautiful from there

this you will not get by listening or reading but only by going there

in paris you can also get face to face with the secretive smile of mona lisa from a distance of one foot

it is not so that there are only paintings of leonardo da vinci there

there you will also see the artwork of pablo picasso and monet

besides this there is a glut of museums in paris

taking a pass in euros you can see all museums within two days

if there is no charm of seeing museums then spending just euros can try to know the secret of the smile of mona lisa in the louvre museum

if you have read the da vinci code then you will get reminded of that pyramid here which is mentioned with great detail in that

here taking a ticket you can also take the pleasure of a cruise in the seine river

notre dame louvre and eiffel tower all are made beside this river

you can call les pusage de saint ouen the thief market of paris

here you will get everything in very less money like the thief markets of delhi and mumbai

this market sets up every saturday to monday

go and rinse this market properly who knows you might get the kohinoor for the value of shells

apart from this saint germain des pres les halles and rue saint martin are also such places where you should definitely go

here you can get good things in cheap prices

in paris there are such innumerable things which you can see and do

this can also be said that there is definitely something or the other for every person and every budget

you must remember my last saying whether your budget is of dollars or dollars daily

you will not be able to stay without getting stuck in the love of this lovable city

where to eat in paris

here the street food is not only cheap but also tasty

in less than five dollars only you can take enjoyment of paninis and from crepes to pancakes mc donald is there only

where to stay in paris

in etap hotel a room will be got in euros breakfast free

how to roam in paris

in d euros buy metro tickets

entrance free in louvre museum

excursion to paris approximately in d euros

a joy like being in tune found in the lap of the nature

anoushka shankar told spriha srivastava about the harmonious and beautiful evenings spent in kopanang and goa

for enjoying holidays where do you like to go

without losing any moments i would like to take the name of goa

like to go frequently to goa and spend the best holidays in less money

but kopanang of thailand is that lone place the holidays spent where i can never forget

i had gone there on a holiday of one week with few friends of england

there are not any telephones there

there you will not get any modern comforts like this

so when we reached there we had no reservations etc

there you will get tree house made on trees

you can stay on its platform climbing on the trees

there is a bathroom there containing flowing water

but whatever other things are there that can only be called basic

the area adjoining the shore of the sea is wild

there the cost of spending one night is just thai baht

apart from this there is nothing as such on which an amount can be spent

this is why you can call my this holiday a budget holiday in the right meaning

any special thing of this place that can not be forgotten even deliberately

memories of kopanang are heart touching ones

this place is known for events happening on nights of full moon

there is no proper road there

only an island is there

for going from one island to another island there the only one support is the fish catching boat

this is why when you get off on another island from one island there then you suddenly find yourself on a deserted place

this in itself feels quite attractive

we had set camp on just some distance from this place

where happens the organization of full moon night parties

did you participate in any such party organized there

i like being included in such parties

but by bad luck i was not at that place then when the organization of that party happened

as such this much is fixed that whenever i go on a holiday then i harbor a desire of complete peace and rest

any special place of attraction for travellers there

there is one more place whose name is century spa resort

this is at a distance of two shores from that place on which shore tree houses are built

there is a small resort there

classes of yoga are run over there

i used to go there every morning taking a walk in the direction of the mountains

there used to do yoga practice till few hours and after that used to return

this was the most peaceful moment of the holidays

tell about some more memorable moments which will always dwell in your heart and mind

there was my room partner vicky

she is my friend and lives in london

she and i used to every morning at half past three get awakened on hearing the unknown sound of some big animal

every night our condition remained bad with fear

one night we remained awake to see which animal is that after all

that was basically a big lizard found in thailand

that was almost one feet long and was in our bathroom

it was like our third room partner in our whole stay there

in some days we got used towards its coming in the room hanging on walls and slithering on tooth brush

you had also mentioned goa is this also your favorite destination of spending holidays

yes goa for me is a place like that where i enjoy going again and again

in less expense only holidays can be spent there

for me this is also important in this meaning that this is in our country

i enjoy going there every year

but a few years back what used to be the character of goa that place has not remained very safe now

in many matters the desire i harbor to spend such informal holidays with safety that does not seem possible there

now more than enjoyment i go there with a mission of living a peaceful life

for newlywed couples who want to go for celebrating honeymoon will give them advice to go to kopanang

for celebrating honeymoon this place is also good because here happens more romantic experience

as far as it is a matter of goa then in reality should think of going for getting enjoyment with friends there

there are many beautiful and cheap places to stay there

we had stayed in a beautiful guest house

this was cheap in a very convenient and surprising way

this was beside an orchard of grapes and was very beautiful

the nearest city from there is gros ego

this feels like those cities which are built on mountains

in them sights of medieval times are seen

this is like a historical snapshot of the villages of the surroundings

by going near the waterfalls of hot water can take enjoyment for as long as you want

i do n t remember properly the rent for lodgings but i feel that of one day it was near about of maybe dollars

this rent was of the deluxe room

all conveniences were present with me like hot water etc

this was a very good place

you will also definitely get guest houses of medieval times in dollars

apart from this italian restaurants are present everywhere there

the food was very tasty and along with very cheap also

in reality this was one of the biggest delights of this world

hindi and gujarati are heard in every streets of nairobi and indian sari lahanga etc are common clothes there

it is also advised to be a little cautious about nairobi

incidents like stealing snatching cheating and robbery etc keep on taking place

therefore tourists should avoid going alone to any strange place

the biggest speciality of nairobi are the national parks thereof which are located at a distance of only kilometres in the south of the city

in fact when the aeroplane lands at the nairobi airport then if the traveller see outside through the window then may be they will get to see giraffe running holding its head up

there is a major national park of nairobi

this national park is the major industry tourism of kenya which depend on these unique animals and these animals are such that are found only in africa

guide said that among big animals of africa the names of lion jaguar elephant rhinoceros buffalo come

all these animals of the national park are called big not just because of its size but they are called because they are extremely dangerous

if all these animals of the national park go after someone then his escape is very difficult

in the starting days when hunters used to come to africa with the goal of hunt then the hunter who hunted these big animals were considered brave

among these big animals the most dangerous are buffaloes

when i told the guide that in india people raise these buffaloes and also drink their milk then the guide informed us just then that the pet buffaloes of india are water buffaloes

but the these buffaloes of the national park are king buffaloes which can never be made pet and are very dangerous

given a chance these buffaloes of the national park also defeat lions

moving ahead further in the national park two panthers were seen sitting on a small cliff

turning the vehicle the driver brought it just near them and stopped and said that panther is fastest running animal of the world

tourism industry has emerged as the biggest source of earning foreign currency in india but it has been able to attract only percent of the tourists of the world

india tourism till now has been centred on the places of religious cultural historical and geographical importance

therefore foreign tourists are given the tour to pilgrimages ancient temples historical forts memorials memorials stupas or ruins art galleries museums and pleasant cities and sea shores

tourism based on wild life has not yet got priority in india

tourists in india do not come with an approach solely towards wild life tourism

still gradually an inclination away from historical and cultural tourism towards entertainment and aesthetics based tourism has come and in this change wild life tourism is also included

the location of the national parks forest reserves tiger reserves and other protected areas in our country is in different views residing places and climate areas

therefore they have a divergence and diversity of fauna and flora in them

among the wild animals residing in these protected areas like lions tigers panthers snow panthers elephant wild buffalo ox several species of wild sheep and goat apes monkeys squirrels crocodiles fish wild cats wild dogs bears etc along with colorful birds are natural attraction of tourists

the national parks of africa are vast and no damage occurs to them with the entrance of a big number of tourists together in them

wild animals like lions of africa are tolerant towards tourists while the animals like tiger living in the national parks of india are shy and like to stay away from tourists

it is also a matter of attention that the tourists of african parks are often foreigners which are disciplined and follow the rules and orders with alertness

tourists in the parks of india are generally local people who have not yet developed such behavior that are suitable to follow the rules list of the park

therefore we will have to prepare rules and regulations and codes of conduct according to our situations to run wild life tourism in our country

we need to be more alert to systematise and regularise tourists in our national parks

it has been estimated that among the tourists of the country five percent tourists tour national parks and forest reserves

in those parks of india that can be reached easily and which has achieved fame wild life tourism has increased there

among these parks kajiranga manas sundarban gir corbett sultanpur tadowa sanjay gandhi keoladeo sariska kanha bandipur madumalaya nagarhole bannerghatti periyar are prominent

latest data of tourists touring every year in all of these parks are not available

yet it has been estimated that up to in gir national park and up to tourists in kajiranga national park reach every year

about tourists visit in manas national park also

while periyar national park attract lac tourists every year

sanjay gandhi national park borivali is quite near mumbai metropolis and more than lac tourists come here

in the whole of asia this is the biggest number entering any protected wild life area

about tourists come to betla corbett and kanha national parks

the number of tourists of sultanpur keoladeo and tadowa national parks is from to every year

to tourists come to sariska bandipur sundarban bannerghatta and nagarhole national parks

the number of tourists in the madhav and bandhavgarh national parks of madhya pradesh is nearly to

very less tourists reach parks like dachigam valley of flowers namdafa indravati keibul lamjao pin valley great himalaya parks which are either distant or unreachable

however there is no about in it that the number of tourists going to these parks are constantly increasing and in future there is a great possibility of wild life tourism increasing in india in future

there for the managers of these parks it is necessary that they prepare early schemes to solve the problem of constantly increasing tourists

when we talk about wild life tourism then saying this would not be irrelevant that some tourists do not lose to misuse these guest houses

showing their wealth they break the peace of the parks

they create noise by running transistor and tape recorder and musical instruments on these national parks which are forbidden in these parks

such people inspire the staff of the guest house by giving the lure of their position and wealth to ignore the discipline and rules of the park

guest houses are built in almost all of the parks in our country

so as no problem of residence occurs on reaching in the park one should reserve these guest houses before

these parks are often open for tour from morning till sunset

several parks are closed for travellers in special parts of the year like rains

different fee is decided for entrance accommodation food cameras guides passengers private vehicles etc in the parks

there is a ban on carrying fire weapons inside the park

it is mandatory for tourists to follow some rules to maintain the peace and safety inside the park

tourism is mainly for entertainment

along with entertainment historical and religious tourism can also be achieved

but wild life tourism has a different objective and that is evoking awareness towards the protection and conservation of environment

in this era of the deformity of the nature the message of improvement in the environment has great importance

to bring this message to the tourists parks can play a certain role

tourists should take great precaution and alertness while touring in the complex of the park because any encounter of tourists and wild life due to any lapse can result in sad event

in this regard reminding the incident of the death of a british bird lover on january in corbett national park in such an incident would not be irrelevant

david hunt reached such a desolate place in the dhikala forest range following an owl alone where a wild animal killed and ate him

in the complex of the national park travel is an important part of tourism and this should also be considered

the wild animals get disturbed with the dust generated by the speed of the vehicles inside the park and the sound of the vehicles

therefore controlling their speed and use is necessary

till now our national parks are not fully able to fulfil the demands of wild life

in some parks the tourists cell is in the core area which is not appropriate with regard to nature protection

in several parks designated area for tourists has not been demarcated

nature interpretation centres have not been established in all the parks for the convenience and guidance of the tourists

the arrangement of stay management of traffic in the complex and photo shooting are not available in some national parks

despite shortcomings in the wild life tourism attention is definitely being paid on raising its standards in which needs of tourists are fulfilled

to develop wild life tourism under the development of national parks and sanctuaries project there should be a separate arrangement of financial help for wild life tourism
